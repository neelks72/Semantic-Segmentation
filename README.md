# Semantic-Segmentation
Semantic segmentation using neural networks is the process of assigning a image class to each pixel of the image.   This project uses a Fully Convolutional  Network (FCN) to identify the pixels in a image that correspond to road. The project classifies the pixels of a given image as belonging to the road class or everything else (background)
